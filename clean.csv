1,"Look, they made tremendous strides this year. Really all the offseason moves and acquisitions worked out beyond our expectations and are A+ moves except for Timber, which is an incomplete due to injury. 

Arteta knows his shit, and clearly the organization is on top of its game on player development and acquisition. 

Raya is probably better than Ramsdale, but if we lose the championship by one on GD, i have bone to pick with him. 

Rice is everything we expected and more. 

Harvertz, who I called Hazard due to being out of position so much, has turned out even better than expected and a great addition. 

Trossard, who some guys might end up being the biggest surprise in the mix has turned into exactly that. 

We are really one more good goal scoring striker, and I said it that way on purpose, from winning it all this year.  We all forget how young this team is sometimes.

Compared to just barely missing out on champions league every year, we are in a much stronger position. 

Geaux Gunners and Geaux to hell Chicken Cocks and MC. "
2,The arsenal direct site took down the home kits. Will you be purchasing the new kit right away?
3,Planning on buying the tickets shortly. When we saw them in Baltimore it was clearly identified which side the teams would be on but I can‚Äôt seem to find out. Anyone know if they‚Äôre on the west or east side?

5,"Is it not a teams responsibility to win the premier league not rely on other teams to win it for them?
I think blaming Tottenham for not winning arsenal the league is as bad Tottenham fans happy to lose a game. 
Here is hoping Arsenal wins its last game. Then will it be west hams fault? Or will west ham win the title?"
6,"Nobody is BLAMING Tottenham. Nobody. We're disappointed that they lost, but that one loss didn't win city the league."
7,"In a vacuum

Arsenal lost one more game than they were allowed.

In reality 

City built a team on the back of shonky practices so that even a team, who have won the league undefeated, that exceeds their best ever wins record doesn't win the league.

This is also not even close to comparing to when Liverpool scored almost 100 points and didn't win it.

Aside from that Spurs fans twerked for city to beat them. That is why we will give them shit for losing this game."
8,"You are getting it wrong. We are not laughing at Tottenham because they lost because lets be honest, that was a crazy run of fixtures with barely any breathing room in between I think even the best team will struggle. The manager and players are professionals and will want to win every game. If you lose a game.. you lose a game.. end of.

What we are laughing at is the fanbase, their culture and their loser mentality. Mourinho said it was the only fanbase he could not connect with, Conte said in all his years of management he has not seen anything as bad (and that Man has managed in lower teams in Italy) and now Ange... (who has never managed in a top 5 league btw), is slowly starting to understand that Spurs may be the shittiest club he has ever managed."
9,Yeah guys like this have completely missed the plot.
10,This is the way
11,
12,"Any recommendations for pubs you‚Äôd be able to get into on Sunday around the Emirates to watch the match?
Don‚Äôt have a match ticket and only get into London on Sunday so can‚Äôt go to the Tollington‚Ä¶"

15,Why did someone make this?
16,"It‚Äôs inevitable, but if by any chance‚Ä¶ Gooners ü§ù Irons, #DoItForDeclan. Any West Ham fans strolling through to see the vibes, just think, the bonus your team will get from Declan winning the league, might be enough to get another signing in for Mr Lopetegui. "
17,Do it for premier league football in general..everyone‚Äôs sick of these cheating city cunts

19,How can you tell that's Gunnersaurus?
20,You're right. My bad. I shouldn't have made assumptions. :)
21,Show me another picture where the entire Arsenal fanbase went from elation to being absolutely gutted in 3-4 seconds‚Ä¶Son has never missed this finish in his goddamn life.
22,Son of a b*tch.
23,I‚Äôd get you one of Lord Bendtner shooting wide away to Barcelona after RVP‚Äôs preposterous red card. A goal woulda taken us past them in the Champo.
24,Would have been so much worse if he had scored it and they still conceded the penalty five minutes later.
25,Son has 1/3 to 2/5 of the goal to his right to score but decided to take the harder option.
26,Tried to meg him
27,And we're saying their supporters are obsessed with us.....
28,Trash. Pure Trash
29,Hang that one in the louvre and add √òdegaard taking a picture in the corner
30,"get over it, don‚Äôt make this a thing pls! people miss 1v1 every season i cba seeing this as a season defying moment"
31,I swear it didnt look like he took the shot from that far when I saw it live
32,"It's quite a distance from the goal and the keeper came out well. 

Not a sitter everyone assumes it is."
33,He didn‚Äôt miss - keeper saved it
34,Fabregas on that christmas day :(
35,We can't take credit for ending your season.  Unai Emery can.
36,Not Sons job to win your title for you.
37,B*tch of a Son
38,That game felt like amateurs on purpose from hotshit spurs
39,I can still feel my blood pressure raising for RVPs red.
40,Damn this still sits in my memory after more than 10 years
41,<shudders>
42,That red was criminal
43,"""Barn door"" Bendtner, as in couldn't hit the side of"
44,"They pull even, they probably would have changed their style of play‚Ä¶good chance the penalty never happens."
45,There would‚Äôve been no penalty. This goal would‚Äôve changed the run of play.
46,Son only scores 42% of his 1 on 1‚Äôs and that‚Äôs the highest conversion rate from that goal scoring position in the league. So just based on the odds alone. There was more chance he misses there than scores. The only reason it feels shit is because he has scored so many of them in the past.
47,He kicked it straight at the keeper
48,His job is to score goals for his own team. He failed and now will play in Azerbaijan
49,"Never said he played for Arsenal, more commentary around how he is usually absolutely lethal from that spot and that range‚Ä¶would have helped immensely, yes, but the game wasn‚Äôt over after that and nothing says they wouldn‚Äôt throttle the Hammers 8-0 while we only managed a 2-1 victory."
50,Nah it‚Äôs to win games for Spurs.  Did he do that?
51,His job is to try and win trophies for his team. You can safely say it‚Äôs been a total failure.
52,Tbf. Fired more shots than Arsenal against city.
53,They needed a win. Also they are Spurs so they inevitably would have found a way to lose
54,They‚Äôd still be Spurs.
55,Completely‚Ä¶I‚Äôve seen Son feather that finish expertly around the keeper or chip it over as Ortega was already on his way down when he made the attempt‚Ä¶frustrating.
56,He was going for the between the legs finish
57,So very true‚Ä¶poor Ange‚Ä¶
58,And they‚Äôd still be shite
59,"Son would give his life to Spurs, did you think he‚Äôd score against City to do you lot a favour, lol"
60,"If West Ham draw on Sunday I won‚Äôt bad mouth them for all of next season.

If West Ham win then I will wear their shirt for a week.

I‚Äôm doing my part ‚Ä¶"
61,If west ham draws or wins ill get an arsenal tattoo. We're all doing our part mate
62,"With the way the fucking spurs fans relished in losing yesterday, I want to believe there is some cosmic reckoning coming on Sunday."
63,And if they lose?
64,If West Ham won you better wear their jersey when they play against us.
65,"Fuck it, if the boys have got snowballs chance in hell of winning the premiership I‚Äôm all in, come on hammers.
Also love this team and so happy with the season win or lose"
66,If they win I'm buying a jersey.
67,"Yall are delusional if you think they can beat city.

Just be happy with the season and focus on next year"
68,They have to support Chelsea for a season
69,"Let‚Äôs see what happens. Early penalty and then the legendary Moyes bus park, maybe we‚Äôll see a 1-1 draw"
70,"Yea, it can be either 0:0 (i give it less than 3% of chance) or anything above 2 goals for city"
71,More likely losing 7-0 to city
72,He is a scoring machine this season with 22 goals and 12 assists
73,No he‚Äôs actually bad. Just a product of the Eredivisie. I watched him a lot at Leipzig and he floundered against increased competition.
74,"Nah, rather get Watkins."
75,
76,Too soon ü•≤ the pain is still raw
77,Wiltord trying to keep Henry's erection down. Now you can't unsee it.
78,I‚Äôm in no mood lol
79,"C'mon, f-ing Hammers. 
We could use a title on the anniversary."
80,"20 years later, potentially ending the season trophyless. what a shame, we should do better than that"
81,"That s Lauren, mate. But good one üòÇüòÇ"

94,"EXCLUSIVE: Premier League clubs to vote on proposal to scrap VAR from next season. Resolution formally submitted by Wolves to abolish system + will be on agenda at June 6 AGM. Any rule change needs 2/3s majority (14 of 20 members) to pass (David Ornstein)

  
[https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5495032/2024/05/15/premier-league-var-vote/](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5495032/2024/05/15/premier-league-var-vote/)"
95,This will just make it worse. The ones who are running it are the problem
96,They should be voting to scrap PGMOL
97,"It‚Äôs frustrating that even with replay, they still make mistakes. But that‚Äôs an easier problem to solve than trying to find officials who can make those close calls 100% right without replay. 

There‚Äôs no way scrapping VAR makes the game better. It just makes excusing the mistakes easier, and what good is that?"
98,"keep VAR, throw PGMOL into the trashcan instead."
99,No. Things were way worse before VAR. The problem is the refs not the tech
100,Scrap VAR? What will we complain about then next season?
101,"For me, VAR has destroyed the essence of football. Errors in officiating are part of the game and on the whole, they balance out through the course of a season. There is no perfection in subjective decisions."
102,I TOTALLY agree with that....wankers.
103,"For me, the automatic VAR for offsides calls is the only solution I would agree to. Otherwise, put a ref in each penalty area for penalty calls."
104,"like we used to, the refs"
105,Couldn‚Äôt disagree more.  I‚Äôm sure the Invincibles would love to have a 50 plus unbeaten streak if there were VAR to review Wayne Rooneys dive.  And yes I‚Äôm still bitter about that 20 years later.
106,Getting calls correct has destroyed the essence of football‚ÄΩ
107,"Well, again, there is no perfect in football. Thats just part of the game. The sad truth is that is the way it has always been. Unless they put 3 more refs on the field, there is no way to prefect imperfection."
108,They aren't correcting calls they are destroying the game
109,"It does not require more refs. They can operate drones and put more cameras to have footage. They can review stuff without stopping the game and announce decisions on any game pause. They can communicate with match going audience and folks watching TV. They can use automated goal line and semi automated offside(that would just require 4 cameras at least) to operate and provide enough visual clarity. They can use screens on stadiums to show video footage of moment reviewed. They do not need match referee to do ""the walk"" to the screen as in VAR room there is another referee who should be able to overturn onfield decisions instead of just backing his pal. Referees can talk to audience. And list of possible solutions goes on and on. 

It is people, the officials that have to be held accountable for how things are done. How rules are written and applied. And audience being proactive enough to ask for stuff to actually get anywhere instead of just going with the flow. It is audience that provides the most crucial thing for this entire thing to exist - money. No audience - no money, no ads, no promo deals. So if audience does not exercise their rights and will - nothing will improve just because."
110,"You're not making an argument, you're just making wild claims"
111,"How are they destroying the game? Before it was far more common for the ref to make an incorrect offside or penalty call. VAR corrects most of these mistakes. 

Yes it will fall short occasionally but nothings perfect. They are not ‚Äúruining the essence of the game‚Äù, that‚Äôs a nonsense stance."
112,Your view.
113,"For me, because you cannot celebrate a goal till after they approve of it. Takes away the emotion of the game. Beyond that, they get as many calls wrong as right and for me, that's not worth destroying the game with unnecessary time outs. If they cannot see with a single replay that there was an egregious error, leave the decision on the field."
114,You're literally not making an argument
115,"That is your personal opinion. The facts suggest otherwise - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32794432/

Bottom line is VAR has improved the overall accuracy of a referee‚Äôs decision, this is not up for debate. 

I disagree with the emotion part. If anything VAR actually increases the emotion in the game a lot of the time, especially when it comes to a game changing call."
116,Naa it's a nightmare and has done nothing to improve the game. The marginal improvements in accuracy are far more offset by the disruption. I say bin it.
117,The paper you cite indicates that the average wait is 22 seconds. That is factually not the case in the UK. Automatic offside calls are fine. I am for them.  The fact that in three consecutive games our players were subjected to dangerous foul play that VAR never addressed. That paper does not address the big miss that VAR is in reality.
118,"The paper I cited was in response to you implying that VAR doesn‚Äôt improve the accuracy of a referee‚Äôs decisions. It does period. 

The check time is a separate debate. You can argue it needs to be more streamlined or whatever, but at the end of the day it reduces the number of times teams will be screwed over."
119,Well we are talking about the UK where VAR is a disaster that has not in any way improved the game
120,Then the FA should look into how they can improve it. Rather than scrap something which will enhance the fairness of the game and make it less likely for bullshit like Garnacho‚Äôs offside goal at the Emirates to stand and earn teams an undeserved victory.
121,I agree that they should. Sadly they are not even willing to do that. OB should be automatic. As should offside.
122,
123,City troll alert
124,"It's incredibly pathetic how Arsenal live rent free in your head even as your own club are on the brink of achieving something historic. Even you know it's hollow and tainted with nearly a decade's worth of cheating. 

Also, one domestic abuser who got semi famous for saying stupid things saying yet another stupid thing doesn't make the point you think it does.

Fuck your cheating club, fuck your bald fraud of a manager, fuck all your whiney cunt players, fuck your soulless club's corrupt, backwards owners, and, lastly, fuck you."
125,"Well, I mean, firstly that‚Äôs just a handful of drunk people, not an entire stadium chanting against their own team and arguing with their own manager‚Ä¶ and secondly it‚Äôs a hypothetical and not a situation that really occurred, and therefore totally outside the scope of this debate. There is no possible real-world situation in which Arsenal losing a game could lose Tottenham the champions league final."
126,The day man city fold will be a fantastic day.
127,who's whiney now?
128,"TIL ""whiney"" = stating facts. I guess you would have to be that stupid to proudly follow and cheer for a sports washing fraud of a team."
129,"Pls arteta,give them a chance"
130,"I think Cedric Elneny and Nketiah would be given a run out in final 5 mins to say good bye.

Unless it's a 1-0 lead and City are drawing."
131,Come to this comment when City draw and we win üèÜ
132,"Please, im not‚Ä¶"
133,You never know we have to play like they might draw
134,"Start Martinelli, Trossard, kai, jesus, obi - 5 strikers formation ü§ò"
135,It would be nice for Smith-Rowe to get some minutes as it looks like he might be sold in the summer... however if West Ham are performing miracles and we need a win then maybe not
136,Not Fabio.. please
137,"keep the mediocre boys in the bench, and fight hard until the last whistle with the proven XI"
138,In sport its never over until its really over.. have some faith. Worst case it wont happen. For me as long as mathematically its a possible scenario - *its a possible scenario*!
139,
140,Vieira
141,Odegaard or Rice?
142,√ñdegaard?
143,"Cedric, of course."
144,Odegaard.
145,Saka?
146,Rice
147,Anyone who watches the games knows that this isn't true.
148,Will put an ‚ùå on wrong answers rather than a down vote ü§ù
149,"Thats tough, odegaard is our best passer but rice is our best set peice taker, idk who to choose tbh"
150,Big Willy
151,"gonna go Jorghino , was tempted for trossard but no goals on there"
152,Ben White
153,Ben white
154,Shocking to read this is supposedly Vieira. They must be talking about PATRICK VIEIRA because surely Fabio Vieira isn't strong in any definition of the word!
155,Jorginho?
156,Thomas
157,Havertz
158,Partey?
159,Trossard
160,Thats Saka or White.

169,Odegaard

173,Odegaard
174,Rice
175,Odegaard
176,This is silly.
177,Marty
178,Saliba
179,It's clearly rice right
180,Big kai
181,Is it havertz?
182,"Either Viera or Henry. But since only a midfielder can ‚Äúhave no significant weaknesses‚Äù, imma go with Viera."
183,I‚Äôd be surprised if it‚Äôs not Rice.
184,"I mean the data sample size has to be incredibly small...

He really didn't get that many minutes this season. I think he's a good player and all but a lot of his minutes didn't come at the most critical times.  

It's always easy to take a snapshot of a game and look at the players stats but you need a much bigger sample size to really say that he is the best at these things on the team or anything like that...

I do like him though, and the name doesn't hurt."
185,‚úÖ
186,"Patrick, right?

Right?"
187,‚ùå
188,‚ùå
189,"DUB, but no üòÇ"

205,‚ùå
206,"WHAT ‚ÅâÔ∏è

my very first and emphatic guess was √∏degaard, so to hear it being vieira is definitely a surprise. i really hope we get to see more of him next season"
207,That defensive contribution strength would have thrown a lot of people off the scent.
208,As in Patrick Vieira.
209,How can it be‚Ä¶no way his strong defensively and in the EPL he definitely ain‚Äôt very strong at holding on to the ball with sharp and strong defenders physically overwhelming him‚Ä¶not the first time I seen flawed assessments on whoscored
210,Lol
211,Cleopatrick Vieira? Now I'm confused.
212,Man needs more time to cook!
213,"And long shots isn't even there, which to be fair he is clearly very good at also. 

Very interesting player and a unique profile in the squad, I pray he stays fit! He and Odegaard can be a real creative force. He is a really top player imo."
214,"When I saw Viera as the correct response my first thought was Patrick and then why is this pertinent. The fact that it‚Äôs this Viera honestly makes little sense to me. Ode is our best and most important ALL AROUND player then Saka, Saliba and mother fuck‚Äôn Kai is more believable."
215,"Holding onto the ball doesn't necessarily mean strong, but keeping possession/not wasting the ball. Which is definitely something he is strong at. He uses the ball very well."
216,Only on the wing...
217,"That's a really interesting stat, thanks for sharing. He went under my radar this season compared to our many, many other talented players"
218,"Shit, how did I miss Rice. Ode/Rice is the only true answer."
219,"[I want to hear the tape.....](https://preview.redd.it/ukjo636vcm0d1.png?width=595&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c9b44aaa69e691b3044fd61737afa6b32e92f06)

"
220,Want to hear the VAR call on the penalty as well. Defender looked to have won the ball.
221,It was interesting they didn‚Äôt announce that it had been checked.  It‚Äôs super close. Looks just as close as the decision in our game against Tottenham.
222,The refs are in the tank for City. I saw a stat that showed how many decisions they have go their way...shocking
223,No lines drawn that is for certain.
224,
225,"Jesus fucking christ, it's like Gollum and Carrot Top had a drunk lovechild."
226,Stupid sexy moyesy
227,"a spurs fan will think i'm being 100% serious but if David kills Goliath and we don't lose to Everton, Moyes gets a statue, right?"
228,The sexiest Scott until Karen Gillan came along.
229,That‚Äôs terrifying
230,"Park that bus mr moyes...  

May Areola be in the general area of the goal"
231,"and he was blessed as Sir David Moyes, master of the 5% possession win.

Hail"
232,Hell Yeah
233,
234,
235,"I just want to remind everyone that City is just maintaining their average pace of 90+-5 pts. In fact barring one year 2020-21, they won > 90pts. 

The major challenge (or milestone) for us is to consistently finish with at least 90pts every season. Once we can do that, we earn the rights to win the league. 

This year the supposedly ‚Äúweakened‚Äù City squad still effortlessly on track to finish above 90 points."
236,Let's hope some of the 'Wonderkid' can rub off on the Hammers on matchday.
237,"If nothing else the pain of our chances sipping away is being offset by all the memes, creative posts and seeing London rivals line up to root against us."
238,"Fabianski scores the equaliser in the 90+6th minute, after we‚Äôve just annihilated Everton 6-0. How‚Äôs your goal difference Peppo?"
239,Send over CC and some coaching staff to help West Ham prepare.
240,Especially if they have Kai Havertz warming up in the background.
241,I‚Äôm just gonna put $100 on city to win.  I either make some money or we lift the trophy.
242,11 players in the goal. Easy.
243,I have been looking into the logistics behind loaning Declan Rice back to them for a last hurrah with his old coworkers
244,"nate the great, he had a pretty great story line in the 3rd season of ted lasson"
245,"Yea I'm kind of sad at how everyone is okay rolling over for city because they can convince themselves it doesn't count. 

They aren't near good enough to even pressure them so we're left to fight it out tooth and nail with teams showing up against us and writing off their city games before a ball is kicked."
246,The W√ºnderki√±d can definitely do this
247,At this point goal difference doesn't matter. We need to win and we also need city to lose or draw. Their chance make goal difference a factor was against Tottenham and we're still ahead after that game. So it's city's title to lose if they draw or lose against West ham. If they win its over for us.
248,That‚Äôs the move! Emotional hedging.

250,Worst loss that jersey saw in 2024
251,"RM70,000 down the drain..

255,funny but villa is still worse
256,"That was, unfortunately, in the home jersey."
257,we lost 1-0 away. lost twice to villa this year
258,i‚Äôm sorry see you are saying in 2024 so you‚Äôd be right
