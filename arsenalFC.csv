People having been digging up old articles about our pitch being wet and saying we're 'dirty' for it (it's Liverpool, it's always wet here).

Liverpool didn‚Äôt make any mistakes here at all. This wasn‚Äôt a let off for Arsenal at all. 
Now that I think about it, it‚Äôs clear that the reason Trent missed was probably due to the gravitational pull of Declan rices massive balls on the ball. 

See, if you look closely. Declan rice is within 2.5 feet of the ball and his ballsack weighs about 8 oz. A standard size football inflated at 8psi weighs just enough to be influenced by the gravitational forces emitted from Declan rices super sexy aura and nutsack. 
Had he been 2 cm to his left then Trent probably would‚Äôve scored, but we paid 100m for him and his massively sexy ballsack so he honestly should get all the credit here. 

Great job Declan rice. Super epic moment

If we had Ramsdale in goal, like he said himself, I couldn't trust him to stay focused all game at 100%. Raya said it in his post match interview with Meeks, Kate, Titi and Carra. You need to stay focused and in the game at 100% for 100% of the game as anything could happen at any moment. 

Raya is top class. Always has been. Obviously a shaky start but Arsenal is literally one of his families most idolised teams and as such him playing for us is a dream not just for him but his family, specifically his grandfather.

We don't really care about the charges because we don't view the allegations as immoral. In our view (or at least my own), all the owners did was inject capital into the club to help it compete with established competitors. Had City relied purely on organic revenues for their player & infrastructure investments (i.e. relied on cup winnings, t-shirt sales, ticket sales to fund improvement) we would have never improved. Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal, all maintained a legacy advantage in this regard. Think of it this way: if you were entering a new market against established competitors, you'd want to do whatever you can to even the playing field. For city fans it would have been more of a moral quandary if the club was still prodigally spending, well over their competitors. But after establishing a level playing field, City has maintained a healthy net spend. Basically, we look at it like start up capital. I know this may be frustrating for some fans to read. I get that. And honestly, no provocation was intended. I was just trying to give the city fan (or at least my own) point of view.",-1,0,

I'd hate to see this happen to Arsenal, you've done amazingly well over the past couple of seasons and it would be great to see you lift the title this year. From being in the relative doldrums for a few years to being a real challenger, it's good for the league to have proper competition from a few teams. I don't consider 115 as being competition, they're a fantasy team put together in apparently dodgy circumstances and devoid of any feeling. A shit club that can barely sell out their own ground, quite why they're bothering to expand it I have no idea.

You really think an investigation that began in December 2018 due to leaked emails, taking 4 years and partly ending in 115 charges in February 2023, was all based on the same evidence that‚Äôs been public since 2020? That‚Äôd be pretty wild.

Why are the Premier League so confident to charge in the first place? Why didn‚Äôt they just drop non-compliance charges and forget the whole thing? Why would they take 6 years until the first hearing?

Why aren‚Äôt City complying? What haven‚Äôt they complied with up to Feb 2023 to warrant **35** charges? Surely if they had the unequivocal evidence proving their innocence they‚Äôd have bedded this mess years ago? 

I think people have seriously underestimated the lengths that the PL have gone to. Going after the main money maker in the league the way they have hasn‚Äôt been based off a whim (the emails) and I think all you City fans know that.

1520,Comment,1asu916,Rival fans won‚Äôt like this‚Ä¶,YooGeOh,2024-02-17 12:14:07,"It's true though. Ronaldo was playing on the right of a 442. His primary job was to get to the byeline and cross the ball, not necessarily contribute to goals. Not primarily anyway.

If you were old enough to understand during that era, what it meant to be a winger was completely different to what it meant to be a winger today. Ironically I think Henry started that shift with his propensity to operate from the left wing and cut inside. The people started copying Barca and the 433 and they started putting fast strikers on the wings and inverting them. The focus then became having wingers that scored and played primarily in the final third. In Ronaldos early years the focus was for wingers to stay wide and help their fullback. Their movement was straight line vertical; byline to byline.

Therfore a direct comparison of goals and assists doesn't mean anything. The position has changed, the expectations have changed, and the literal areas of the pitch a player was expected to play in has changed. Ronaldo was only part of a FRONT three in the last few seasons at United. The word FRONT is very important as in a 442 you aren't playing in a FRONT anything.

All that said, it wasn't a harder league lol. I'm not buying that part. It is however important to apply tactical context here, and tactical context makes this a pretty pointless post",1,0,

The two players being compared 
- played for different teams
- played under different managers and styles
- played at different times (largely)
- played against different opponents

This doesn‚Äôt make for a useful comparison.

To bring it to life a simple example would be comparing the 97/98 season with 22/23. 

97/98 winners Arsenal scored 68 goals

22/23 winners City scored 94 goals

Whilst its only two data points, it illustrates changes in the league over time. Should we argue that Spurs‚Äô 8th place finish last year with 70 goals is superior to the title winning Arsenal side of 97/98?",1,0,

There‚Äôs no context of any positives of coming second coming third . It‚Äôs toxic and exhausting and rips away the heart of the sport. 

When the team wins, it‚Äôs us, but when the team loses, it‚Äôs them. Loyalty spans and reaches only as far as success. 

This is more particularly exacerbated when you compare it to American sports where the lexicon and surrounding the second place the runner-up is a matter of glorifying their effort giving grace to the fact that they got there but ultimately giving flowers to the winner . it fuels an attitude of let‚Äôs come back next year and do better and try again and even failure we can consider our effort and work worthwhile.

That is very absent in a lot of posts in the sub . I appreciate most real fans of the club share my belief that this is the beginning of a very promising an impressive project. And excited expectation that we would win the Premier League and Champions League was a heavy expectation.

last season as soon as it was crunch time they crumbled 

this season the first game the season was in our own hands we crumbled

the first somewhat competitive team we face in the cl we crumbled

our performance again villa? shit

our performance against bayern across both legs? shit

we struggled to even make it this far in the cl lol

these players have the audacity to ask for the same wages as players like Modric, Salah, De Bruyne etc but the second the pressure hits and we are in with a chance of competing for a trophy they crumble they offer absolutely nothing and the 40+ games leading up to that point was a complete waste of time.

  
can you honestly say that if city lose their next game or their last game of the season you believe that these players have what it takes to go on a run and win our remaining games to punish city? exactly you have as little faith in them as I do 

  
I love Arteta I love Arsenal and I love these players but the truth is the truth and I am not afraid to criticize them like some people who paint them as heroes no matter what they do.

across the games that matter what have these players dont to earn their wages?

  
Saka : ¬£300,000 a week after bonuses

Havertz : ¬£280,000 a week

Jesus : ¬£265,000 a week

Rice : ¬£240,000 a week

Martinelli : ¬£180,000 a week

you can even be harsh and add in others players like Saliba, Odegaard etc who have been anything from fine to good but never exceptional in any of these crunch games 

Arsenal are paying nearly ¬£200million a year in wages and winning nothing you can praise them for being competitive but being competitive means nothing if you never win, no ones remembered for being competitive and you can even argue Arsenal aren't competitive as we all know everytime we get down to the important part of the season we will crumble again like we did in the CL, like we did in the Europa league and like we have the last 2 seasons in the PL.",-7,0,

Even when they are mocking other teams it just seems low because they have no team allegiance (unless the company sponsors x team). 

Working in marketing myself, imho it's not tasteful, nor ""cheeky/personable/relatable"" brand messaging to just give and give without being able to be targeted and take any flak in response. (I mean in terms of bantering whoever they support in the football context, of course you can act in response by not supporting said company).

It realistically just runs the risk of you losing more customers than you're likely to gain. Seen this sort of stuff happen time and again and the response always seems to be mostly negative, so no idea why people handling their social media still think this is a smart move if they are generating largely negative instead of positive awareness.",1,0,

1.) We have these kinds of chances regularly in other games and don‚Äôt always score - everyone is focusing on it because frankly it was our only opportunity 

2.) The pass was actually never on because of his first touch. You can pause it on a frame like this but he couldn‚Äôt actually pass it at this moment as the ball is at his feet after he recovers from the first touch.

The only way that ball goes through to Martinelli is if his first touch was perfect (more towards goal) and he immediately passes to Martinelli

The window where that pass is clear and (relatively) easy to make is so small and is gone quickly. 

However, I feel like people are talking about this pass as if it would have left Martinelli with a tap in into an open net. Even if Trossard sees and completes that pass, there‚Äôs still a way to go and a high level of skill involved to score the goal so I‚Äôm not convinced that this is THE pass that would have won us the game purely if the pass had been made. It feels about on par with other moments where we could have been more accurate with our shots, made a better pass or passed instead of shooting or made better runs in the box. One better decision in a lot of those sort of moments would also have created better chances but this one is the one I see dog piled on and the likelihood of a goal feels a bit exaggerated.",3,0,

It was too late and he had to shoot by then. Trossard has more than enough ability to make this pass and should be expected to. It didn't happen and it is what it is.

People are assuming it's a guaranteed goal if Trossard crossed it.

I don't think he had the time in the end, first touch was ok but he didn't have enough pace so the cross would likely have been blocked. Defender stuck to him and didn't give him space.

He needed to cross it first time IMO but you've also got to assume Martinelli can control the ball coming at pace and then slot it in the net. In all likelihood he makes a poor first touch, gets blocked off by the defender or rushed by the keeper.",1,0,

I‚Äôm not sure why Martinelli was playing on the right and trossard on the left. If they‚Äôd been switched, Martinelli with his pace would‚Äôve gotten much more space on the defenders and he could‚Äôve found trossard on the right, who is a better finisher.

What I regret about this transfer is that Shaktar played the hard ball from the start. Also, what they said really angered me, at the time. They said they valued Mudryk, based on the same amount United paid for Antony. I was like ''Come on! Are you that dumb ? Or you really want to spark a war between us and Chelsea to see who will pay the highest fee ?'' I heard reports that Mudryk cried after that deal didn't went through in our favour, which I believe. Otherwise, he wouldn't have dropped lots of hints about his wish to play for Arsenal, nor give an interview with Zinchenko's wife. I regret how this transfer didn't go through. But I like how Edu and the Board responded by moving swiftly to buy Trossard (because Chelsea and Liverpool were also interested). In him, we got a really interesting player, who can play in different positions on the pitch. He's a decent and hardworking guy, and scores beautiful goals",1,0,

Yes, you're buying potential with Caicedo, moreso than Rice on the basis that he's a little bit younger. If you'd watched Caicedo for 40+ games last season it's pretty clear that this guy plays *way* above his age. His footballing intelligence is really quite something & would have you believe that he's a 26-28yo player with hundreds of apps under his belt.

Caicedo is good. I was impressed by him. I wanted us to sign him in January but Brighton said no. That's okay, but I don't think he's worth ¬£100m and if I had to choose between Rice or Caicedo, I think I've made it clear who I would choose and why.

Arteta would never want to leave a club he played for and loves. Especially for an unknown rebuild project that could take years to correct, if it can be fixed at all. The rot is deep in Manchester and has been for a while. And even with INEOS and Sir Jim coming in to help the team, they still might be washed. Remember, the Glazers are still there.

Let‚Äôs think about this logically and take away the ‚Äúheritage legacy‚Äù that comes with being the manager of ManU. That legacy has been left on life support, much like Arsenal in the past couple of decades. What it took for us to get out of that mess was to bring in a manager with vision, goals, and with a prior link to the team. 

So to lay out the scenario as Rio sees it‚Ä¶ Arteta comes to Arsenal, busts his ass over the next five years to take this team from perennial Europa League participants (and for a few years no European comps at all), to going for more than just a top four spot qualification to the CL, but challenging for the PL title as well. So he‚Äôs going to take all that hard work, all the analysis of players to fit the system, gets them all on board with his tactics, gets it where it is almost perfect, short of winning major trophies and honors.
