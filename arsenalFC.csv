1,Post,1ct1i0b,"Hey Goons, very proud of our boys regardless of what happens Sunday. ",Jackfish2800,1715823279.0,"Look, they made tremendous strides this year. Really all the offseason moves and acquisitions worked out beyond our expectations and are A+ moves except for Timber, which is an incomplete due to injury. 

Arteta knows his shit, and clearly the organization is on top of its game on player development and acquisition. 

Raya is probably better than Ramsdale, but if we lose the championship by one on GD, i have bone to pick with him. 

Rice is everything we expected and more. 

Harvertz, who I called Hazard due to being out of position so much, has turned out even better than expected and a great addition. 

Trossard, who some guys might end up being the biggest surprise in the mix has turned into exactly that. 

We are really one more good goal scoring striker, and I said it that way on purpose, from winning it all this year.  We all forget how young this team is sometimes.

Compared to just barely missing out on champions league every year, we are in a much stronger position.

Arsenal lost one more game than they were allowed.

In reality 

City built a team on the back of shonky practices so that even a team, who have won the league undefeated, that exceeds their best ever wins record doesn't win the league.

This is also not even close to comparing to when Liverpool scored almost 100 points and didn't win it.

We are not laughing at Tottenham because they lost because lets be honest, that was a crazy run of fixtures with barely any breathing room in between I think even the best team will struggle. The manager and players are professionals and will want to win every game. If you lose a game.. you lose a game.. end of.

What we are laughing at is the fanbase, their culture and their loser mentality. Mourinho said it was the only fanbase he could not connect with, Conte said in all his years of management he has not seen anything as bad (and that Man has managed in lower teams in Italy) and now Ange... (who has never managed in a top 5 league btw), is slowly starting to understand that Spurs may be the shittiest club he has ever managed.",4,0,

They can review stuff without stopping the game and announce decisions on any game pause. They can communicate with match going audience and folks watching TV. They can use automated goal line and semi automated offside(that would just require 4 cameras at least) to operate and provide enough visual clarity. They can use screens on stadiums to show video footage of moment reviewed. They do not need match referee to do ""the walk"" to the screen as in VAR room there is another referee who should be able to overturn onfield decisions instead of just backing his pal. Referees can talk to audience. And list of possible solutions goes on and on. 

It is people, the officials that have to be held accountable for how things are done. How rules are written and applied. And audience being proactive enough to ask for stuff to actually get anywhere instead of just going with the flow.
